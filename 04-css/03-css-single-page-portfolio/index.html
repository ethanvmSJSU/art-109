                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">My name is Ethan Vilchis Macedo, I am a Chicano student currently attending my fourth year here in San Jose State University. My art consists of sketches and concepts for character designs, both through digital and physical mediums. Often with my pieces, I incorporate intricate line work and line-weights in order to make the character’s detailing pop more, alongside complimenting the line work with colors; often being vibrant and rich. I want to specialize in graphics design, but also put my focus on character designing and conceptualizing. Often a lot of costumes to me should tell a story, or paint a picture into whom the character is like or what his potential goals are. A lot of the works that I often do utilize the concepts of Super Heroes and their backgrounds of who they are, such as why they became heroes to begin with. A lot of these aspects tell us a story, conceptualizing the hero and eventually showing us that persona coming to life. In this case, a lot of these superheroes tend to have a lot of political backgrounds and reasoning to why, and that is something that I want to consider bringing into my art and storytelling.</p>

                    <img src="images/SPIDER-MAN.png" style="width: 500px; height: 650px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" alt="This is my take on the classic Peter Parker Spider-Man costume for Marvelous Prodigious Sensations, my take on the Marvel universe.">
                    <h3>THE PRODIGIOUS SPIDER-MAN</h3>
                    <p>This is of my take on the Amazing Spider-Man, calling him the Prodigious Spider-Man. He sports a similar layout to the classic red and blue tights, but giving him some different colors, and symbols. He is still recognizable, but still my own.</p>

                    <img src="images/BLACKCAT.png" style="width: 500px; height: 650px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" alt="This is my take on the classic Felicia Hardy Black Cat costume for Marvelous Prodigious Sensations, my take on the Marvel universe.">
                    <h3>THE BLACK CAT</h3>
                    <p>This is my take on the Black Cat, simply titled as Black Cat. I decided to do something different with this character, giving her a different background and also a different type of costume. Instead of the leather tights, I gave her a free runner style costume. More comfort and also just overall better breathing room. </p>

                    <img src="images/WANDERER.png" style="width: 675px; height: 500px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" alt="This is my Spider-Sona called The Wanderer. This is a more personal project that's a spin off of Marvelous Prodigious Sensations.">
                    <h3>THE WANDERER | SPIDER-SONA</h3>
                    <p>This is my Spider-Sona. He has a similar style to my Spider-Man, but I gave him some clothing rather than keeping the spandex suit motif. Similar red and black layout, but giving him stripes on his mask, alongside with missing the webbing.</p>
